# FORK info

This is a FORK of the excellent project JPEGView by David Kleiner https://sourceforge.net/projects/jpegview/ .  Unfortunately as of 2020, the project has essentially been abandoned, with the last update being 2018-02-24 (1.0.37).  I'm hoping with this fork, some devs might help me keep the project alive!  It's an excellent lightweight image viewer that I use almost daily!

I've FORKed this repo directly from SourceForge, as this project could use some updates.  I'm hoping some users will make suggestions, and devs will do pull requests on this project as it'll be a learning curve for me to pick it up. -sylikc

The way it was forked, it retains all previous commits and all author comments.  Releases will be made through GitHub.
