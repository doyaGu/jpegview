# Software Repositories

Users have requested that JPEGView be submitted to multiple different software repositories.

Most open repositories have public manifests files, so these files aren't considered private.

## WinGet-sylikc.JPEGView

These are the latest YAML files used to submit to the WinGet repository.

See README.txt for more information.  Will change with updates.  These files are _not_ required to compile JPEGView.
