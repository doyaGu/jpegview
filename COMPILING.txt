JPEGView source code readme
***************************

To compile JPEGView you need:

- Visual Studio 2019 professional or community editions (JPEGView 32 and 64 bit versions supported)
- Visual Studio 2017 professional or community editions (JPEGView 32 and 64 bit versions supported)
  (Configured to build XP-compatible versions only, does not include all current features, does not include MSI installer)
- Windows Template Library (WTL), Version 8.1+ (http://sourceforge.net/projects/wtl/) installed to
  $(ProjectDir)..\..\deps\WTL-sf (This can be be automatically populated by cloning the submodule)


To compile the MSI installer, you need:
- WiX Toolset v3.11 or later (https://wixtoolset.org/releases/)
- WiX Toolset Visual Studio Extension for your version of Visual Studio


Please note:
- Windows XP SP2 or later is needed to run the 32-bit version (When built from VS2017).
- 64-bit Windows 7 or later is needed to run the 64-bit version.


NOTE: VS2019 is the current active JPEGView development environment.


Legacy Solution files
*********************

NOTE: after the tag "last-cpp14-code", there is code that requires C++17.  This code will not work on previous versions of Visual Studio.
      An #ifdef is used to disable that feature when compiling for standard below C++17

Older solution files have been removed from the source tree.  If you still need them, clone the tag v1.2.45
