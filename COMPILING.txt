JPEGView source code readme
***************************

To compile JPEGView you need:

- Visual Studio 2019 professional or community editions (JPEGView 32 and 64 bit versions supported)
- Visual Studio 2017 professional or community editions (JPEGView 32 and 64 bit versions supported)
  (Configured to build XP-compatible versions only, does not include all current features, does not include MSI installer)
- Windows Template Library (WTL), Version 8.1+ (http://sourceforge.net/projects/wtl/) installed to
  $(ProjectDir)..\..\deps\WTL-sf (This can be be automatically populated by cloning the submodule)


To compile the MSI installer, you need:
- WiX Toolset v3.11 or later (https://wixtoolset.org/releases/)
- WiX Toolset Visual Studio Extension for your version of Visual Studio


Please note:
- Windows XP SP2 or later is needed to run the 32-bit version (When built from VS2017).
- 64-bit Windows 7 or later is needed to run the 64-bit version.


NOTE: VS2019 is the current active JPEGView development environment.


Legacy Solution files
*********************

NOTE: after the tag "last-cpp14-code", there is code that requires C++17.  This code will not work on previous versions of Visual Studio.
      An #ifdef is used to disable that feature when compiling for standard below C++17

Older solution files are no longer maintained.  They have been preserved for other devs who may be using older build environments.

- Visual Studio 2013 professional (JPEGView 32 and 64 bit versions supported)
- Visual Studio 2010 (JPEGView 32 bit version supported)

To build on these older solutions, you must point to the WTL directory:

The include directories of WTL must be added to the include directories for VC++:
In Visual Studio: Properties of JPEGView project > VC++-Directories-Include Directories and Library Directories
                  Include Directories: $(VCInstallDir)WTL\Include;$(IncludePath)
